# react-spinup
This is a series of small projects based on Bob Ziroll's free course[^course_link] titled "Learn React" on Scrimba.


## Purpose 
> My goal with this undertaking is to watch through his tutorials one by one, then try to re-create his work on my own.

### Project 1 - Create a Static Page Using React
#### Purpose:
1. Re-discover React setup basics
2. Become comfortable with common terms that will be used in future projects
3. Build a very basic, reusable component

#### Final Product:
![Static Page of React Facts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46723642/169919693-261a84f0-9bda-4f41-8104-b5831e82b72d.png)
